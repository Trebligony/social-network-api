# social-network-api

The challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 

# Coding requirements

I'll be using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

# User Story requirements

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


# Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB
database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
